# Advent of Code

## What is it?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of coding challenges created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).
These challenges are a great way to learn a new programming language or just have fun with problem solving.

## Why am I doing this?

I've been curious about Zig for a while now so I wanted to start learning it using Advent of Code challenges.
I'm starting from the first year of Advent of Code,
which is [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) and I will attempt to solve as many of them as I can using Zig.
